<p style="font-size 32px"> -Mental health awareness is critical because it impacts daily life and well-being. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that one in eight people globally live with a mental health disorder. Despite the prevalence, stigma and lack of understanding often prevent individuals from seeking help, which can lead to negative consequences like impaired performance at school or work, relationship problems, and even self-harm. Raising awareness helps create a supportive environment where people feel safe to address their mental health challenges
